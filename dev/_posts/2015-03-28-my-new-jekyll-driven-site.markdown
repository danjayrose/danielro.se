So, I decided to give Jekyll ago and host my website on Github pages. I have also integrated <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">{{ site.baseurl }}</a> with Cloudflare, taking advantage of it's CDN and flexible SSL to use HTTPS. All for FREE! My website is now superfast - gaining full marks on <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">http://www.webpagetest.org/</a>. Nice.
